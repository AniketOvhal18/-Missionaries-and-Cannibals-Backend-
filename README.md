# -Missionaries-and-Cannibals-Backend-
Welcome to the Missionaries and Cannibals game! This project is an implementation of the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem in Python. The game challenges players to transport missionaries and cannibals across a river using a boat, adhering to certain constraints to avoid losing the game.

# Features
Interactive Gameplay: Play the game interactively in any Python environment.
Robust Backend: Well-structured backend logic to handle game mechanics and constraints.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Compatible with any Python compiler, making it easy for anyone to play and enjoy the game.

# Game Rules
The boat can carry a maximum of two people.
At any point in time, if the number of cannibals is greater than the number of missionaries on either side of the river, the missionaries will be eaten, and the game will be over.
The objective is to safely transport all missionaries and cannibals to the other side of the river without any missionaries being eaten.
